under @modal you can define folders with "(.)foldername"
the "(.)" means "go up one level"
The page.tsx inside the "(.)foldername" gets rendered at the position of the modal tag at the parent's page.tsx

outside the @modal you can define a folder with the name "foldername"
The page.tsx of "foldername" will be rendered when the page is reloaded and will become a child of it's parent's page.tsx
